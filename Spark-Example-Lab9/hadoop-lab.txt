Part 1. HDFS and MapReduce
The purpose of Part 1 is for the student to establish credentials on the Heinz College High Performance Computing Cluster and to run a simple MapReduce job.

You will find your login ID on Canvas. Look in the area where your grades are normally posted. Look under "Cluster Login ID". There you will find a one or two or three digit number. To form your login ID you must concatenate the string 'student' with the number expanded to exactly three digits. Here are some examples:

If your number is 1 then your login ID is student001. If you number is 17 then your login ID is student017. If your number is 98 then your login ID is student098. If you number is 102 then your login ID is student102.

Here are two links to examine what is going on on the cluster:

http://heinz-jumbo.heinz.cmu.local:50030/

http://heinz-jumbo.heinz.cmu.local:50070/

Output from System.out.println() statements is available in log files.
To view the log visit:

http://heinz-jumbo.heinz.cmu.local:50030/jobtracker.jsp

Find your completed job in the list. On the left, click on the job ID. Select the map or reduce task. Select the task number and then the task logs.

Your initial password will be provided in class.

Before doing this lab, you will need to have the ability to run a secure shell. You may use putty or some other secure telnet client.

To work from home, you will first need to install Cisco's AnyConnect available from CMU's software download page shown next.

https://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/cisco-anyconnect/index.html

The TA's will be using time stamps on files to verify on-time or late submissions. So, please do not perform any unintended work after the deadline for an assignment.

Before beginning, I highly recommend that you make a bulk replacement in this file. That is, I would suggest that you change every occurrence of the string "mm6" with the user ID that you have been assigned, e.g., student003. You may do this with a local editor. In that way the commands that you will use below will be tailored to your machine. For example, student110 would change every occurrence of the string "mm6" to the string "student110". This will prevent common typing errors. It will allow you to copy and paste commands.

Note that the tab key is useful for showing your command history. After using the tab key, you may hit return to execute commands that you previously ran.

Note too that there is a Unix help sheet on Canvas. It is named "UNIX Commands Quick List". Note too that we have provided a short linux tutorial. See Canvas and look for LinuxTutorial.mp4.

Log in to the Hadoop cluster by using SSH to connect.
ssh -l mm6 heinz-jumbo.heinz.cmu.local
Note: If this ssh fails, it may be a problem with your DNS configuration. Use an IP address instead of the name. Ask a colleague to ping the name (heinz-jumbo.heinz.cmu.local) to see the IP address.

On a MAC, if you receive the error message "No Matching Host Key Type Found" then try the following (replace mm6 with your own ID):

ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa mm6@172.19.10.29
You must change your password now. Use the "passwd" command. PLEASE remember this new password.

Your password requires a capital letter, a number and one of the following characters: !@#$%^&*()_-+=.

üèÅNow, complete the 'quiz' that is on Canvas so that your password is available to the TA's for the course. WE NEED THIS TO GRADE YOUR PROJECT 5. The quiz is called "Cluster Password Quiz". Show your TA. This is the 1/4 point checkpoint.

It is highly suggested that you continue and do the following steps.

Your current directory is /home/mm6. Verify this with the "pwd" command.

Create a directory named "input" and one named "output" in your /home/mm6 directory.

mkdir input
mkdir output
Verify this with the "ls" command.

For testing, calculate PI with the following command:
hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-examples-*.jar pi 10 100000

Twenty mappers may be employed with the following:

hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-examples-*.jar pi 20 100000
Verify: Did the system compute a reasonable value of PI?

How did we use parallelization to compute Pi? See the course slides.

Normally, to upload files, we will use "scp" (secure copy) to transfer files to the cluster.

For now, simply construct a text file (pico or vi) and place it under your /home/mm6/input directory.

cd input

Verify with "pwd".

Run the pico editor and create a file called "test".

pico test

Copy and paste this file into test. By "this file" we mean the document you are currently reading. Use ^o followed by ^x. The ^ symbol is the control key.

^o is used to write out the file to disk. ^x is used to exit the pico editor.

Copy the directory where the input resides to HDFS. Note: This is a different file system.
cd ..
hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal /home/mm6/input /user/mm6/input

Look in the HDFS input directory and see if test is there.
hadoop dfs -ls /user/mm6/input
Run word count using MapReduce:
hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-examples-*.jar wordcount /user/mm6/input  /user/mm6/output

Note: we are counting all of the words in all of the files in the input directory. In this case, we only have one file, i.e., the file named 'test'.

If you get an error then you may have to remove an old output directory with

hadoop dfs -rmr /user/mm6/output
And run word count again.

See if the result files are there:
hadoop dfs -ls /user/mm6/output
Place the results in the output folder in your /home/mm6/output directory.
hadoop dfs -getmerge /user/mm6/output ~/output/
Examine the results:
cat ~/output/output
How many times did the word 'the' appear in the file? __________

How many time did the word 'you' appear in the file? ________

You may view what jobs are running on the cluster with the command:

	hadoop job -list
You can kill a job that is not making progress. Do this if you need to. You will need the Job ID.
	bin/hadoop job -kill job_201310251241_0754

Part 2. Apache Spark on IntelliJ
For the Spark part of this lab, we have had more success running JDK 8 than JDK 17. JDK 17 has been tried several times with no luck.

Please download and install JDK 8 for the remainder of this lab.

Run IntelliJ and select File New project
Name the project Spark-Example-Lab9
Choose Java as the language
Choose Maven for the Build System
Use JDK 8
Right click the project and do the following to install the Spark library. Open Project Structure/Libraries/+/From Maven Enter org.apache.spark:spark-core_2.10:1.0.0 Select Download to the path provided Select Transitive Dependencies OK, OK, Apply, OK
Drill down and right click the Java node and select new Java class
Create a Java class named WordCounter.java with the following content:

import org.apache.spark.SparkConf;
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaPairRDD;
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDD;
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext;
import scala.Tuple2;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class WordCounter {

    private static void wordCount(String fileName) {

        SparkConf sparkConf = new SparkConf().setMaster("local").setAppName("JD Word Counter");

        JavaSparkContext sparkContext = new JavaSparkContext(sparkConf);

        JavaRDD<String> inputFile = sparkContext.textFile(fileName);

        JavaRDD<String> wordsFromFile = inputFile.flatMap(content -> Arrays.asList(content.split(" ")));

        JavaPairRDD countData = wordsFromFile.mapToPair(t -> new Tuple2(t, 1)).reduceByKey((x, y) -> (int) x + (int) y);

        countData.saveAsTextFile("CountData");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("No files provided.");
            System.exit(0);
        }

        wordCount(args[0]);
    }
}
We need a file to process. Right click the project node and select "New File". Give the file the name hadoop-lab.txt.

Use the file that you are currently reading and copy it to hadoop-lab.txt.

We need to specify the file name as a command line parameter. Select the project node. From the Run menu, select Edit Configurations.

You may need to "Add new run configuration...". Choose "Application". The main class is WordCounter. Set the command line argument to the name of this file: hadoop-lab.txt Set the working directory to the directory holding hadoop-lab.txt.

The configuration's Build and Run should show java 8 SDK and the working directory will provide a path to hadoop-lab.txt.

Compile and run the Java application.

The output file will be in a directory named CountData in your working directory.

If you get a "file already exists exception", be sure to delete the output directory named "CountData" in your working directory. Spark does this so that a large output file is not accidentally erased.

üèÅ For credit for this part (3/4 point), show your TA that you have a file called part-00000 and it lists a word count of this file.
